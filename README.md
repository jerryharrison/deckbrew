## Running Yourself

Deckbrew requires an existing Postgres database, accessible using DATABASE_URL.
A URL from Heroku or Amazon RDS will work. If you're running your own database,
setup it up using these commands.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE deckbrew WITH template=template0 encoding='UTF8'
```

## Adding a new set

- Update the standard and modern format definitions
- Add the pricing name information to tcg player

## API Documentation

The DeckBrew Magic: The Gathering API is [open
source](https://github.com/kyleconroy/deckbrew-api).  Please report any issues
or bugs you encounter. This API wouldn't have been possible without the amazing
[mtgjson](http://mtgjson.com) and [mtgimage](http://mtgimage.com) resources.

All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from the `api.deckbrew.com` domain.
All data is sent and received as JSON.

### Current Version

The DeckBrew API is currently in **beta**. Backwards incompatible changes
may be made at any time. 

> Content-Type: application/json

### Pagination

Requests that return multiple items will be paginated to 100 items by default.
You can specify further pages with the `?page` parameter.

    $ curl https://api.deckbrew.com/mtg/cards?page=2

Note that page numbering is 1-based and that omitting the `?page` parameter
will return the first page.

#### Link Header

The pagination info is included in the Link header. It is important to follow
these Link header values instead of constructing your own URLs.

    Link: <https://api.deckbrew.com/mtg/cards?page=3>; rel="next",
      <https://api.deckbrew.com/mtg/cards?page=1>; rel="prev"

The possible `rel` values are:

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| next | Shows the URL of the immediate next page of results.| 
| prev | Shows the URL of the immediate previous page of results. |

### Errors

Any response with a status code greater than or equal to 400 is considered an
error. An error object will be returned with an `errors` key pointing to a list
of errors for a given request.

> GET /mtg/page/not/found

```js
{
  "errors": [
    "Card with ID '123' not found"
  ]
}
```

## Magic Cards

to narrow the search.
