<h2>Deckbrew is shutting down</h2>
<p>
  On May 1st, 2018, the Deckbrew API will shut down. When I set out to build Deckbrew, there were no REST APIs for Magic cards. While I always wanted to do more with Deckbrew, I could never find the time. Thankfully, <a href="https://scryfall.com/docs/api">Scryfall</a> showed up on the scene about an year ago. They have a dedicated team and an API that is better in every way.
</p>
<p>
  I've <a href="https://github.com/kyleconroy/deckbrew">opened up</a> the Deckbrew codebase for anyone that is still interested in what the API looked like at the time.
